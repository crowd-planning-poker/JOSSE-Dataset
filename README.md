# JOSSE-Dataset
As part of the research work that investigate the ability of crowds to predict an expert-comparable estimates for software development and maintenance tasks, it was crucial to find such tasks that are annotated by expert estimates, and descriptions. In the same time, it was essential for those tasks to be open so public crowd can predict them. Up to our knowledge, the literature has no such data set. Therefore, this abstract will illustrate details about two main topics, JIRA Open Source Software Effort (JOSSE) Data set, and Crowd Planing Poker (CPP) research replication pack.
